#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
    reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
    efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
     scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
     security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    Reliability: Ensures that software systems function correctly and consistently.
    Scalability: Enables systems to handle growth in users, data, or functionality.
    Maintainability: Facilitates updates and improvements over time.
    Efficiency: Reduces development time and costs through structured processes.
    Innovation: Drives the creation of new technologies and solutions.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    
    Planning – This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, timeline, resources, and feasibility. It ensures that the project aligns with business goals and is achievable.
    Requirements Gathering & Analysis – In this phase, stakeholders provide detailed functional and non-functional requirements. Analysts document user needs, system specifications, and potential risks.
    Design – Architects and developers create system architecture, data models, and UI/UX design. This phase includes high-level (overall structure) and low-level (detailed component) designs.
    Development (Implementation) – Programmers write code based on the design specifications. The software is built using programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
    Testing – The developed software undergoes rigorous testing (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs before deployment.
    Deployment – The software is released to users. This may involve deployment to production servers, cloud environments, or app stores, with monitoring for potential issues.
    Maintenance & Support – After deployment, the software requires updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback and changing requirements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

            1. Approach:
        Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, meaning each phase (Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous development and frequent reassessments throughout the project.
        
    2. Flexibility:
    Waterfall is rigid and does not easily accommodate changes once the project has started. In contrast, Agile is highly flexible, allowing teams to make adjustments based on ongoing feedback.
    
    3. Phases:
    Waterfall has strictly defined phases, while Agile breaks the development process into smaller cycles or sprints, where planning, coding, and testing occur simultaneously.
    
    4. Documentation:
    Waterfall requires comprehensive documentation before development begins, ensuring clear requirements and structure. Agile, however, emphasizes minimal documentation, prioritizing working software over extensive paperwork.
    
    5. Customer Involvement:
    In Waterfall, the customer is mainly involved at the beginning (requirements phase) and the end (after development is complete). Agile encourages continuous customer collaboration, with frequent feedback loops throughout the project.
    
    6. Testing:
    Testing in Waterfall happens only after development is completed, which can lead to delays in discovering and fixing issues. Agile incorporates continuous testing during each sprint, leading to early detection of bugs and faster resolution.
    
    7. Delivery:
    Waterfall delivers the product only at the end of the project, while Agile delivers working software frequently, allowing for faster time-to-market and iterative improvements.
    
    8. Risk Management:
    Waterfall has a higher risk of failure if requirements change mid-project since adjustments are difficult. Agile reduces risk by making incremental changes, ensuring adaptability to evolving requirements.
    When to Use Each Methodology
    Waterfall – Best for Predictable and Well-Defined Projects
    
        Example: Developing a medical device software that must comply with strict regulatory standards.
        Scenario: Suitable for projects with clearly defined and stable requirements where changes are minimal.
        Industries: Healthcare, aerospace, finance, and government projects.
    
    Agile – Best for Dynamic and Evolving Projects
    
       Example: Developing a mobile app with frequently changing user requirements.
        Scenario: Ideal for projects where customer feedback is crucial, and requirements may change over time.
        Industries: Software development, startups, e-commerce, and game development.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software Developer:
    Writes code, implements features, and fixes bugs.
    Collaborates with designers and QA engineers to ensure functionality.
    Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
    Tests software to identify bugs and ensure quality.
    Writes test cases and automates testing processes.
    Project Manager:
    Plans and oversees the project timeline, budget, and resources.
    Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA):
    Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in a single environment, improving productivity.
    
    Version Control Systems (e.g., Git, SVN):
    Track changes to code, enable collaboration, and allow rollback to previous versions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    Changing Requirements:
    Use Agile methodologies to adapt to changes.
    
    Technical Debt:
    Regularly refactor code and prioritize clean architecture.
    
    Team Collaboration:
    Use tools like Slack, Jira, and Git to improve communication and coordination.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions.
    Importance: Ensures each part works correctly in isolation.
    
    Integration Testing: Tests interactions between components.
    Importance: Verifies that combined parts work together.
    
    System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole.
    Importance: Ensures the system meets requirements.
    
    Acceptance Testing: Conducted by end-users to validate the system.
    Importance: Confirms the system is ready for production.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to guide AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to produce desired outputs. It involves crafting clear, specific, and contextually relevant prompts to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.

Importance of Prompt Engineering

    Improves Output Quality: Well-designed prompts lead to more accurate and useful responses.
    Reduces Ambiguity: Clear prompts minimize misunderstandings by the AI.
    Enhances Efficiency: Saves time by reducing the need for multiple iterations.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague Prompt:
    "Tell me about history."
    Improved Prompt:
    "Provide a brief overview of the causes and key events of World War II, focusing on the period between 1939 and 1945."
    Why Improved:
    The improved prompt is specific about the topic (World War II), time frame (1939–1945), and focus (causes and key events).
    It eliminates ambiguity and guides the AI to produce a concise and relevant response.
